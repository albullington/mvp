There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Glassdoor for women

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Glassdoor is a great starting point for finding the right company, but it doesn't always have the information women care about. 

## Summary ##
  > This application will allow women to search for company reviews, salaries, interview tips, work-life balance (including materity leave info) provided by women. Need authentication / login to make sure only women are posting. It will show the percentage of women in management positions and the breakdown of what types of roles women have in the company (a company can be diverse but only have women in admin roles, for example).

## Problem ##
  > Companies are becoming more focused on D&I, but they're still not transparent. This application will give women the real picture of what type of treatment they can expect in a company. 

## Solution ##
  > Many solutions are focused on calling out the particular men involved - see the #MeToo movement. This solution is designed as a warning system, empowering women to tackle this issue before anything serious happens. 

## Quote from You ##
  > "We need better ways to break down the glass ceiling. Women need a place where they can find out about the experience of other women when assessing a new job. 

## How to Get Started ##
  > It's as easy to use as Glassdoor. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Women care about different things than men in a workplace -- we're looking for work-life balance, fair salaries, and places where we can spend time with coworkers during the day if we have to go pick up our kids at night. We care about women being in management positions and not being interrupted in meetings. This finally gives me a fair picture of how women are treated in a workplace BEFORE I take a job."
